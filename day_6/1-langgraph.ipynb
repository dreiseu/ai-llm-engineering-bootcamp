        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

            "[AIMessage(content=\"LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a machine learning technique designed to efficiently adapt large pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains. Instead of retraining the entire model, LoRA adds lightweight, low-rank matrices to the original model, which contain new weights that modify the model's outputs. This approach significantly reduces computational requirements and training time, making it easier to fine-tune large models for particular applications. LoRA is especially useful for customizing models like language models or vision transformers without the need for extensive resources.\\n\\nTim Dettmers is a researcher and assistant professor known for his work in making foundation models more accessible and resource-efficient. His research focuses on open-source AI systems, on-device machine learning, hierarchical architectures for large language models, and scientific automation. He has developed tools like bitsandbytes to help reduce the resource requirements for training and deploying large models. Dettmers has received multiple awards for his contributions to AI research.\\n\\nAttention in machine learning refers to a mechanism that allows models to focus on specific parts of the input data when making predictions. It assigns different weights to different elements in a sequence, enabling the model to prioritize relevant information. This concept is inspired by human attention and has revolutionized natural language processing and other fields by improving the ability of models to handle long sequences and complex data.

As these models became more capable and widely used, the importance of effectively interacting with them through well-designed prompts also grew. The term and practice of prompt engineering started to break onto the scene around 2021-2022, coinciding with the increasing adoption of LLMs in various applications and the recognition that prompt design could greatly influence the quality of AI-generated outputs.\n",

This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already acquired during its initial training on large, general datasets, and then refines it to improve performance on specialized tasks. Fine-tuning typically involves adjusting the model's weights through additional training epochs on the new dataset, often with a smaller learning rate to make subtle adjustments.\n",
